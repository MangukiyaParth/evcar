                    <p class="csrnewsub">Off the back of the deal between Lucid Motors and Aston Martin, Peter Rawlinson, CEO and CTO of Lucid Motors, has stated that Aston’s decision to go with Lucid rubber stamps its claim to have 'the most advanced electric motor in
                        the world'. In case you missed it, “the whole partnership with Aston Martin is worth in excess of 450 million". In an interview with TG.com, Rawlinson is careful to not tell us anything we don’t already know (boo) but claims
                        the money isn’t the point. “It's great for us because it's a validation point of our technology. Yeah, it's got $450 million, thank you. </p>
